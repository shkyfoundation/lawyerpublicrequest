        <p><strong>To:</strong> Hon'ble Sanjiv Khanna Sir<br>Chief Justice of India<br>Supreme Court, Delhi, India</p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Requesting to take Action against "Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav" for his Derogatory Statements</p>
        <p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
        <pre>
Respected Sir,

I am writing this by considering myself a responsible citizen of India. Requesting you to take action against "Justice Keshav Kumar Yadav" - A Judicature from Allahabad High Court. 
He quoted various derogatory statements which are harming the integrity, fraternity, and secularism of our country. 
The statements mentioned below are clearly not suitable for any Indian citizen to pronounce it in public or in private. 
As he is holding a constitutional post, it's not suitable for him to make such public statements. The statements are totally against the idea of our nation and Constitution as well.

<b>The statements made by him (Justice Keshav Kumar Yadav):</b>

1. Every citizen living in India is a Hindu, no matter which religion he/she follows.
2. Country will lead by majoritarian idea, and this is law.
3. How can we consider Muslim children will be tolerant and generous, as Muslim children are raised by showing them cruelty over animals/animal sacrifices.
4. "Kathmullah's" are hazardous for the country.
5. Muslims are hurdles in national growth.
6. Muslims always mislead people.
7. If we are non-violent, then please don't consider us as cowards.
8. No other can make this country a world leader apart from Hindus.

Please look into the matter and do the needful at the earliest. Thanking you in anticipation.
As a citizen, I seek action against him.

Yours sincerely,  
Indian Citizen
